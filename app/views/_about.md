This is a simple [mood board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board) for [Nat](http://natwelch.com). 

It is pulled from [his DeviantArt favorites](http://calvin166.deviantart.com/favourites/) and his [Dribbble likes](http://dribbble.com/icco), and provides a random sampling from them.

He originally built this as a way to find inspiration. Nat has found over the years that many people have created great art on dA that is interesting, beautiful, and/or inspiring. By taking a random section of these images, he hopes to find a way to break through things like creative block, and the like.
